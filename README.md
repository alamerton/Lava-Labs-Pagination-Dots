## Pagination Dots

Code repo for the list of page indicator dots on the right-hand side of some pages. This code can be placed on specific pages by placing it on any but the first section of a page. Placing it on the first section of the page prevents the script from indicating that the screen is on the first page when the page opens. Alternatively, the script can be place in the header code injection text box under 'website tools' enabling the effect on every page on the website. I haven't done this because

## pTag.html

This HTML element must be placed in a code block on any section that you want the pagination dot list to index. Just edit the number of the id to reflect the section number in order starting with 1.
